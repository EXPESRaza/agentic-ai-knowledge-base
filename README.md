# 🧠 Agentic AI Knowledge Base

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Knowledge Base** — a curated set of technical guides, developer notes, and architectural discussions around building Agentic Generative AI applications.

## 🚀 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that exhibit autonomy, reasoning, planning, and tool use. These systems go beyond simple completion tasks by:

- Making decisions based on goals
- Reacting to environmental inputs or user queries
- Leveraging memory, planning, and reflection loops
- Orchestrating tools and sub-agents

## 📚 Who is this for?

This knowledge base is for:

- AI Engineers & Researchers
- Backend Developers integrating LLMs
- Builders using Langchain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, etc.
- Anyone building practical agent-based applications

## 🏗️ Structure

- `articles/`: Markdown files covering deep dives into agentic design, planning patterns, evaluation methods, and more.
- `assets/`: Supporting diagrams, flowcharts, and architecture visuals.
